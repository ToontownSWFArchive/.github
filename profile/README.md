# Toontown SWF Archive

Maintained by: Loonatic

All assets extracted using [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)

Repositories include special URLs that allow you to browse assets in a gallery. Example can be found [here](https://toontownswfarchive.github.io/jp_coghq_index/).
- This is performed by a GitHub action that clones & builds the [github-pages-gallery repository](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/github-pages-gallery).
